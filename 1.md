1. The data we used is the `data.csv` in `code(python-flask&jupyter)`;
2. Open the `Individual Project-2.ipynb`, you can see the detailed python codes about data analysis (data cleaning and regression model) and some plotting.
3. By dragging the `Python-Flask` file in `code(python-flask&jupyter)` to terminal and run `flask run` in terminal, you can open the website locally.
4. In `Python-Flask` file, `data.py` contains the codes about data processing and plotting and transfer the processed data to `app.py`. 
When you clicking the button on the website, it will invoke the function in `app.py` and then invoke the function in `data.py`, then you can see the interactive website page.
